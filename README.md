The portfolio contains two projects that I worked on in the AP Computer Science class, and the details of each is listed below.

PALINDROME
The Palindrome class defines private instance variables and methods used by the tester class.
 PalindromeTester accepts a user-inputted string and return whether or not the given string is a palindrome

VOWELS
The Vowels class reads an input text file(‘poetry.txt’). It replaces all the spaces with tildes(~) and puts the new text into an output text file(‘vowelsOut.txt’). It also counts the number of times every different vowel appears in the text and places those values in the same output text file.
